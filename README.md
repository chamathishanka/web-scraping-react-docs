# web-scraping-react-docs
This project is a Python script that scrapes the React documentation navigation from [react.dev](https://react.dev/learn) and saves the results in a JSON file. It uses `requests` to fetch the page content and `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML, extracting links and their nested sections. The output is written to `docs.json`.
